# `neww` - Negrel's Experimental Widgets for Wayland

`neww` is a lightweight library for creating standalone widgets in Lua using GTK.
It enables developers to build interactive and declarative user interfaces, 
similar to the [React](https://react.dev) framework in JavaScript.

It is inspired by [`eww`](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) but aims to provide a more
readable and turing complete alternative.

## Features

* Declarative Syntax: Write UI components in a declarative way, making it easier
to understand and maintain your code.
* Component-based Architecture: Organize your UI into reusable and composable
components.
* React-like State Management: Manage component state efficiently using hooks.
* Luax JSX Syntax: Write your UI components using a JSX-like syntax called Luax,
providing a more concise and expressive way to define UI elements.
* Standalone Widgets

## Getting started

Run one of the example under `examples/`:

```shell
make example/bar
